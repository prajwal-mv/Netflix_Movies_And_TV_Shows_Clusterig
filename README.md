OTT platforms have become a normal and usual mode of entertainment in today’s world. There are many popular OTT platforms like Amazon Prime, BigFlix, Arre, Discovery+, etc., competing with each other to increase their user base. Netflix is one of the leading OTT platforms, not only in India but also internationally. The success of the OTT platforms depends on two things- the variety of content and appropriate recommendations to the users. Clustering is a useful technique to achieve the best possible recommendations and increase the viewership of the platform.

# Problem Statement

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming service’s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting finding
